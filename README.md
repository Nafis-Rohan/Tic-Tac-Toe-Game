# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. It's beginner-friendly, perfect for anyone with basic knowledge of C++ who wants to practice coding and understand how a simple game is built using fundamental programming concepts.

## Features
- 2-player gameplay (Player X and Player O).
- Players take turns selecting their moves by choosing a number (1-9) corresponding to the board position.
- The game checks for win conditions and announces the winner.
- The game also detects draws.
- Simple and easy-to-read code.

## How to Play
1. Run the program in your terminal or C++ IDE.
2. The game will display a 3x3 board with numbered positions.
3. Players alternate turns, entering the number corresponding to their desired board position.
4. The game ends when a player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when the board is full (draw).

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C++.
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or IDE like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, etc.).

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-cpp.git
2. Navigate to the project folder and compile the code using your C++ compiler

## Example Gameplay
